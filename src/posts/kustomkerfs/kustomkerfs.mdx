It's not something we thought much about as we started doing this -- actually building guitars directly for someone.
Obviously, we want all of them to end up with someone, but building from the very beginning, knowing the eventual 
owner and building to their personal specifications wasn't on our radar. 

But I dig it! Knowing that someone is waiting for the guitar is exciting. Makes me want to get to the bench or spray booth
even more than usual. It's fun sending the occasional progress picture and update and sensing the expectation.

I'd do it for you, too. As with the kerfs we build for inventory, the only expectation is that we don't end up out of pocket.
You need to cover costs either by paying for the materials or providing them. After that, we'll get to work.

## The Original Viking

The featured picture is a custom build (based on a Pitbull Guitars XB-1 kit) but from their custom shop with an 
ebony freboard that came with no frets. The client wanted gold on black, so I got the slotted fretboad only and purchased
gold fretwire to install. The goal was that the guitar should be gold on black (and the more gold the better).
The guitar was built for my Norwegian friend and he took the picture of me delivering it to him in Florida when
he was in country for a conference. The inset is the guitar hanging on the wall at his home -- with his other gold-on-black guitars.

## Pretty in Pink

This one was part custom kerf and part kerf rescue. The person that bought the sparkly pink Tele I had for sale
has a thing for pink guitars. He had bought the Jazzmaster and a nice selection of high-end parts for it but
decided after some early setbacks that perhaps he was out of his depth.

He brought the box of parts and guitar to me and we talked through what he wanted. The Pretty in Pink soundtrack LP was
laser cut by someone else to match the orginal pickguard shape and openings. I did a complete refinish on the body, finding
a high quality pink furniture lacquer we could use for that soft pink finish. The wiring on a Jazzmaster is quite interesting
and I learned some things from doing it.

It sounded so cool that it almost made me want a Jazzmaster. Quite an interesting circuit design. It's likely gracing
a stage somewhere in Austin, Texas this weekend.
