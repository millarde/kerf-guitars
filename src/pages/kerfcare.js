      <h1>kerf care</h1>
      <h2>We want you to love playing a kerf guitar, forever.</h2>
      <p>
        Just as we didn't charge for labor to build your kerf guitar, we won't charge you take care of it, either. Still not sure how to change the strings? 
        We'll change them for you, you just need to get it to us and provide (or pay for) new strings. We'll give it a general checkout and tune up while we have it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Been reading about how good a set of upgraded pickups might sound? Bring us your kerf and the parts (including a new set of strings) and we'll 
        install them for you (please check with us first so we make sure the parts you want will work with your guitar). 
        We want you to be delighted with your kerf, though all of it's phases. It should go without saying that if you have concerns, we'll
        address those, for sure.
      </p>
      <h2>Purchase protection</h2>
      <p>
        If you get your kerf home and somehow don't love it, bring it back (unharmed, please, within 2 weeks) and we'll refund your money or maybe 
        find a different guitar for you, your choice. If you later decide you want a different kerf, we'll figure out a reasonable credit for your
        current one towards a trade-in.
      </p>
      <h2>Loaner program</h2>
      <p>
        When we'll need to keep your kerf guitar for more than a day or so to complete upgrades or repairs, you are welcome to a loaner guitar (you do practice
        every day, right?) if one is available. You agree to return it well-played and unharmed.
      </p>
      <h2>Terms of service</h2>
      <p>
        There are no guarantees other than what is mentioned above -- we'll work to make it right or return your money. We reserve the right to refuse service 
        to anyone for any reason. Any and all service subject to us still being in the business of making guitars.
