Here's a peek at what's on the bench and should be available soon (if someone doesn't snatch it first). 

This one's a kerf Custom, for sure. I'm building one like this for a friend and got a second kit
from the Pitbull Custom Shop as a backup. Fortunately, his came out nicely and the backup is about to have a new home.

With the satin black on black finish and Tommy Iommi crosses, what could be more metal? You know what? No Tone Knob.
This one sings full-throated all the time. Tame it, if you can, with your outboard effects.

Gonna set this one up with GHS Boomer Thick and Thins (TNTs) so you can chug-a-chug-chug-weedly-weedly-weedly all night long,
summoning or banishing demons as needed. I have a set of new Seymour Duncan Invaders ($150) that would really help
this one scream if you can cover the upcharge. It already has some fine Grover locking tuners on it that are smooth and easily dialed in.

Final price not yet set. Guessing about $350 as shown, $500 to swap in the Invaders. Either way, with premium gig bag and
as always, kerfcare playing protection.
