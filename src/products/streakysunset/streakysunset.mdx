Enough with the "sunbursts" -- what about a streaky, smokey sky at sunset? 
There's a scuff mark here and there to imply it may have sat around a camp fire or two.

It's your basic Tele-style guitar, setup beautifully. Our neighbor (who is in the jazz guitar program at UT, "hook 'em!")
almost didn't want to give it back after checking it out for us. It is based 
on [this kit with finishing set](https://www.stewmac.com/kits-and-projects/instrument-kits/electric-guitar-kits/t-style-electric-guitar-kit) 
from Stew Mac. Price is $275 and includes premium gig bag.
