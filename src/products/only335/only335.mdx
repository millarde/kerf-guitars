This was our first "335" style build. It might also be our last, as finishing these is a lot of work 
and the kits are a bit pricier 
(see https://www.stewmac.com/kits-and-projects/instrument-kits/electric-guitar-kits/335-style-electric-guitar-kit.html). 

So if you like this style, grab it, as it may be the only kerf like this ever made. We're willing to make more 
(it's beautiful and sounds great) but it will definitely depend on interest as we have some lovely LP and Tele 
style guitars coming that are less expensive. Price is $400 (no bag/case currently availalbe, so no shipping).
